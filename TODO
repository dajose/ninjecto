Fixes
-----

- Fix namespaces.

Documentation
-------------

- Input and output.
- Values.
- Libraries.
- ninjeconf.py
- Configuration and .ninjerc.xxx

Features
--------

- Nice progression: maybe a progress bar, or at least nice logging about what
  Ninjecto is currently processing.
- ninjeconf.py in another directory? (When ninjeconf.py in CWD but source not)
- .ninjerc.xxx in source directory? (When source not in CWD)
  -> ninjeconf.py is loaded from source directory.
  -> .ninjerc.xx is not, gitroot and CWD are the latest too resolution paths.
- ninjecto --create, or ninjecto create <name> (vs ninjecto render): render a
  start template with name <name>.
- Command file to execute render? How to execute it? ninjecto render-project ?
- Add support for ninjecto projects in remote git repositories:
  Allow to specify: protocol, user, (password?), repository, revision, tag or
  branch and subdirectory.
- Change directory to source file? Maybe this could help some people with their
  project setup.

Checking
--------

- Avoid overriding the source: is this mandatory? The cases are at least:
  - If source is a directory:
    - Output in and output is source directory: FAIL
    - Output and output is source directory: FAIL
  - If source is a file:
    - Output in and output is source file: FAIL, that makes no sense,
      output_in must be always a directory.
    - Output and output is source path: MAYBE?! Override the file? Why not?
      Ugly?
- Avoid breaking when system configuration files (non-explicit) are broken.
- What about binary files in the template?
